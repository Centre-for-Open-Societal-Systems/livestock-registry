-- A Farmer Registry change notice about a farmer this registry has never seen.
--
-- The platform's ingestion classifier gives a notice the action ADD when no local Farmer
-- row carries the notice's Farmer ID, and an ADD needs an intake form and a semantic
-- pattern that matches it; without them the notice fails classification and is never
-- delivered. This file supplies both:
--
--   * a Farmer intake form that is used only by the ingestion pipeline and holds the one
--     Farmer identity section, which is all the notice template fills (the Farmer ID and
--     the Fayda ID the notice names; its other fields are never read);
--   * the notice's semantic patterns match that form for ADD as well as the identity
--     section for UPDATE.
--
-- Nothing is approved through that intake. When the pipeline finalizes it, the extension's
-- intake service starts the Farmer reference ADD (signed, consented lookup, then the
-- normal two-stage approval) and closes the intake as cancelled with a pointer to the
-- change request. Known farmers still classify as UPDATE. Idempotent.
